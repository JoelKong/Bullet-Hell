## Mechanics and Gameplay
The objective of the game is to take down the giant spaceship and not die. Users will have to hold the 'W' key to shoot bullets. Users can hold down the 'shift' key to move faster but this will deplete the stamina bar which will restore over time. Health kits will also appear at random timings to aid the user by replenishing its health. The enemy spaceship bullets will sometimes track the user down so beware! Go wild and have fun!
